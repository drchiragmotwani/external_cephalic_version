# External Cephalic Version
3D simulation of external cephalic version using a simulated 4-point mechanical system controlled by Arduino.

External Cephalic Version (ECV) is a procedure to align fetus into head-down position from breech position [1]. It is a non-invasive procedure done through the abdominal wall [1]. This program simulates this procedure using a conceptualized 4-point mechanical system which opens the possibility of automatizing this procedure or providing possibilies for controlling remotely. This can help increase the success rate of ECV, currently which is at 60% [1].

## Analysis
This program outputs the fetal angle and active mechanical point at every timepoint during the procedure. These can be plotted (as below in MATLAB) to asses the performance of different health personnel using the same system.

Color legends refer to different mechanical points being used
